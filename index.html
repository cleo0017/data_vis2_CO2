                <b>Nonrenewable energy</b> is energy that comes from resources that will not be easily replaced.
                In the last few decades, a significant part of the energy and power produced and consumed globally are from nonrenewable energy sources, 
                in particular fossil fuels such as <b><span style="color: #3d403d;">coal</span></b>, <b><span style="color: #cad6eb;"> natural gas</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #5e4219;"> petroleum</span></b> . So, why is this a problem?    
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2 text">
            <p class = "container-right"> 
                Not only does the burning of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), it is also a major driver of climate change.
                As mentioned before, most of the world's energy is supplied by nonrenewable energy which is an issue since once it is used up, it cannot be readily replaced. 
                As a result, we must find alternate and more environmentally-friendly energy sources.

            <h1 class="heading"> Global Power Consumption</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2 text">
            <p class = "container-left"> 
                Firstly, let's look at the global power consumption from 1990 to 2020. Looking at trends in the global power consumption is important
                because it provides us information about which continents or countries are consuming more power, and therefore more energy, than others and why. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2 text">
            <p class = "container-right"> 
                Take a look at the two graphs below. For the stacked bar chart on the left, can you see any trends in the continent power consumption? 
                For the donut graph on the left, try dragging the slider and seeing how the percentage of the total power consumption for each continent changes over the years.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
            <div id="Continent_Consumption_vis" class="container-left"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2">
            <div id="Donut_Continent_Consumption_vis" class="container-right"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2 text">
            <p class = "container-left"> 
                So what do these two graphs tell us? From these two graphs, we can see there is an <i>increasing</i> trend in global power consumption over the years with 
                <b><span style="color: #9f1853;">Asia</span></b> being the continent responsible for the highest energy consumption, followed by the organisations <b><span style="color: #002d9c;">OECD</span></b> (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development made up of 38 countries)
                 and <b><span style="color: #a57c1b;">BRICS</span></b> (acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa known for their emerging economic markets).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-2 text">
            <p class = "container-right"> 
                This makes sense! The demand for energy grows as countries' economies develop and populations expand. Think about how much electricity we use in our life, for our heating, lighting, the internet etc. 
                <b><span style="color: #9f1853;">Asia</span></b> is the most populous continent in the world with more than 4.5 billion people as of 2018 while the <b><span style="color: #002d9c;">OECD</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #a57c1b;">BRICS</span></b> are leading organisations in economic development.
                All of this means they require huge amounts of energy to deal with the growing population and economic demand.

                The earth's atmosphere is made up of a mix of greenhouse gases that trap heat keeping the earth at a comfortable temperature needed for us to survive.
                This is known as the greenhouse effect. These gases can stay in the atmosphere for different amounts of time including a few years to thousands of years.
                However, if the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere gets too high we start to see a rise in the earth's temperature or global warming.

            <p class = "container-right"> 
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions account for the largest greenhouse gas emitted by humans. The chloropleth map below shows CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per 100,000 people from 1980 to 2019
                while the line graph shows a count of the different groups of CO2 emissions (<span style="color: #eca248;">0 to 200</span> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per 100,000, <span style="color: #fd8d05;">200 to 400</span>, <span style="color: #fd6405;">400 to 600</span> etc.) in each year. 
                Try selecting a part of the line graph to see how CO<sub>2</sub> emissions change over the years. You can also select a small range on the line graph and drag it left and right.

                Finally, let's compare the production of nonrenewable and renewable energy. 
                The left area chart shows the production of nonrenewable energy while the right area chart shows the production of renewable energy in TWh (Tera-watt per hour).

                Both graphs are on the same scale from 0 to 160,000 TWh. 
                We can see that the production of renewable energy each year is extremely small compared to the production of nonrenewable energy!
                But it's a little difficult to see any trends in renewable energy production....

                The left graph shows the production of nonrenewable energy over the years. From 1980 to 2019, we can see that the production of nonrenewable energy has almost  <b><u>doubled</u></b>!
                The fossil fuels <b><span style="color: #3d403d;">coal</span></b>, <b><span style="color: #cad6eb;"> natural gas</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #5e4219;"> petroleum</span></b> still continue to produce the bulk of energy consumed globally.

                from 1980 to 2019 we can see that the production of renewable energy has <b><u>tripled</u></b>! 
                <b><span style="color: #5ddae3;">Hydropower</span></b> accounts for the majority of this energy production.

                Over the last few decades there has been an increasing trend in global power consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and energy production. 
                The increase in CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emission has become a driving force of climate change including global warming.
                <br> <br>
                Climate change and the growing power demand means we must look for alternative greener and renewable energy sources including <b><span style="color: #5ddae3;">hydropower</span></b>, <b><span style="color: #e8cf41;">solar power</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #37b860;">biofuel</span></b>.
                While renewable energy production has more than tripled, there is still a long way to go before renewable energy becomes the primary source of energy for the world.
